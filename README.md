# Shine Attendance

Dynamic workforce attendance platform: Next.js (App Router) + MongoDB. MongoDB is the source of truth; Google Sheets is a one-way reporting copy.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local      # then edit MONGODB_URI and the admin values
npm run seed:admin              # creates the initial admin (idempotent)
npm run dev
```

Sign in at `/login` with `ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_INITIAL_PASSWORD`. You are forced to change the password on first login.
`.env.local` is git-ignored. Never commit real credentials.

> Don't run `npm run build` while `npm run dev` is running: both use the `.next` folder and the pages get stuck on a blank/unstyled "Loading" screen. If that happens, stop the server, delete `.next`, and start `npm run dev` again.

## Roles

ADMIN > MANAGER > HR > EMPLOYEE. Nothing is seeded except the admin; add everyone else in the app (or `/users/import`).

| Action | Admin | Manager | HR | Employee |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Create Manager/HR/Employee | yes | no | Employee only | no |
| Edit people | all fields | assignment fields of own team | via request | via request (own) |
| Attendance correction | direct | direct (own team) | via request | via request |
| Void attendance / archive user | yes | no | no | no |
| Approve requests | any stage (override) | manager stage + HR stage | HR stage | no |

Login is User ID + password only (no OTP). The User ID can be the employee ID, email or mobile. Admin (or HR for employees) sets the initial password when creating an account, or leaves it blank for a generated one; users change it at first login.

Authority is Admin > COO > Manager > HR: each can also decide a request still waiting at a lower stage (final, logged as an override).

Request flow: Employee -> HR -> Manager -> applied. HR -> Manager -> applied. Manager -> Admin -> applied. A missing or inactive stage is skipped; with no approver left it waits for Admin. Admin can override any stage.

## Data safety

- "Delete" archives a user; attendance is voided, never destroyed. Login is blocked for INACTIVE/ARCHIVED users.
- Every create/edit/approve/void/settings change writes an append-only `AuditLog` (the model rejects update/delete).
- Tracked profile fields keep a version history (`ProfileVersion`): what, who, when, why.
- Admin actions that change or remove data require a reason.
- Passwords: bcrypt (cost 12), sessions are random tokens stored hashed in MongoDB with an httpOnly cookie, 5 failed logins lock an account for 15 minutes.

## Google Sheets (optional)

One row per person per day (columns: date, employee, location, first check-in, last check-out, hours, all sessions, re-entry reasons, notes). It updates automatically on every check-in, check-out, auto check-out, correction and void. Setup:

It uses a Google Apps Script web app that lives in your own sheet, so no Google Cloud project or service account is needed.

1. Open the Google Sheet, then **Extensions, Apps Script**, delete the sample code.
2. In the app go to **Settings, Google Sheets, Show script**, copy it into Apps Script, and save.
3. **Deploy, New deployment, Web app**. Execute as **Me**, access **Anyone**. Approve the permissions and copy the Web app URL.
4. Paste the URL in Settings, save, then **Test connection**. The tab is created if missing. **Send all past attendance** backfills history.

The script holds a random secret; requests without it are rejected. **New secret** in Settings rotates it (paste and re-deploy the script afterwards). After editing the script later, use *Deploy, Manage deployments, Edit, New version* so the same URL keeps working.

Not exercised by the automated test (needs a real deployed script).

## Tests

`npm run build && npm run test:smoke` runs 28 API checks against a throwaway in-memory MongoDB (downloads a mongod binary on first run).

## Hosting (Cloudflare Workers)

Live at https://attendance.shineinfosolutions.in (Worker `shine-attendance`, built with `@opennextjs/cloudflare`; config in `wrangler.jsonc`).

```bash
npm run deploy                     # build + deploy
npx wrangler secret put NAME       # change a secret (MONGODB_URI, CLOUDINARY_*, SMTP_*, CRON_SECRET)
npx wrangler tail                  # live logs
```

- `APP_URL` and `SESSION_HOURS` are plain vars in `wrangler.jsonc`; everything else is a Worker secret. For local Workers testing put them in `.dev.vars` (git-ignored) and run `npm run preview`.
- Crons (Cloudflare cron triggers → `worker.js` → `/api/cron/*` with `CRON_SECRET`): `end-of-day` every 15 min from 5:30 to 9:15 PM IST checks out everyone once office hours end (default 6 PM); `daily-report` at 8 PM IST marks un-updated tasks as late submissions and emails the day report to `REPORT_EMAIL` only.
- Workers can't share a socket between requests, so on Cloudflare each API request opens its own MongoDB connection (see `withDb` in `src/lib/db.js`); background emails/Sheets sync use `defer()` so they finish before it closes. MongoDB Atlas Network Access must allow Cloudflare (0.0.0.0/0).
- The zone has a `*.shineinfosolutions.in/*` route for `hotel-erp`; the explicit `attendance.shineinfosolutions.in/*` route in `wrangler.jsonc` keeps this subdomain on this Worker.

## Daily tasks, emails and location

- **Tasks** (`/tasks`): HR (and Manager / COO / Admin) assign tasks for a day and mark them Done / Not done in the evening. Not done, never updated by 8 PM, or done on a later day = **Late submission**, score 0. Employees see their tasks and 30-day work status (also on their profile). Synced to the **Tasks** tab of the Google Sheet (no script change needed).
- **Emails**: employees get only welcome / password, check-in / check-out (including auto check-outs) and task-assigned mails. Approvers still get "approval needed"; Admin + COO get changes and alerts. The detailed attendance + task report goes only to `REPORT_EMAIL`.
- **Location never checks anyone out.** A session is open or closed; separately the phone gives a location *signal* (inside / outside / unknown). Three precise GPS fixes (accuracy 20 m or better) beyond the location's outer radius over 2 minutes, or no location report for 20 minutes, raise a **"Still in office?"** check (`lib/presence.js`, `ping` / `presenceSweep` in `lib/attendance.js`). The person answers in the app; no answer in 15 minutes (or "I have left", or "in office" against a precise outside fix) makes the record **Review required**, and their HR / Manager / COO / Admin decides: *was in the office* (no change) or *left* (they set the check-out time). Sessions close only by manual check-out, office closing, or that review. Lunch is never judged. Rough Wi-Fi / cell-tower fixes never count as outside.
- **Reason codes** on every session: Manual check-out, Office closed, Checked out by review, Signal lost, Geofence exit, Employee confirmed, Review required, Reviewed, Admin correction. Every ask, answer, review and correction is in the audit log.
- Defaults: check-in within 50 m, "outside" beyond 100 m (per location, editable).
- **Profile photo**: people upload their own (Admin can change anyone's); stored privately in Cloudinary like attendance photos.
